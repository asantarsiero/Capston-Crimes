## Chicago - 2019 Homicides & Proximity to Venues
Capstone project for IBM Data Science Certificate
This project will help Chicago residents understand in which <i>neighborhoods</i> <b>homicides</b> happened the most and what are the 3 closest venues to the reported crimes.

This study can help the residents of the city understand what are the most dangerous neighborhoods; it can also help residents not living in Chicago - yet willing to move there - have a better idea of the safest neighborhoods in which to move.
