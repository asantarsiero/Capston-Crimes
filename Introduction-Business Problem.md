# Capstone Project
## Chicago - Crimes & Proximity to Venues
Capstone project for IBM Data Science Certificate
This project will help Chicago residents understand <i>in which areas</i> two of the most tragic crimes - <b>homicides</b> and home <b>burglaries</b> - happen the most and what are the 3 closest venues to the reported crimes.

This study can help the residents of the city understand what are the most dangerous neighborhoods; it can also help residents not living in Chicago - yet willing to move there - have a better idea of the safest neighborhoods in which to move.
